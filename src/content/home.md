## What to Expect at KNIT 9?

We are excited to announce that FABRIC attendees will have the privilege to attend the NRP keynote about the NAIRR Pilot, given by Dr. Katie Antypas from the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. Additional sessions include FABRIC keynotes from kc claffy and Arpit Gupta and an FPGA demo / tutorial led by Nik Sultana. We'll plan to share more information about our agenda in the coming weeks.

The workshop will include small-group, hands-on FABRIC tutorial sessions and advanced training topics. During the event, experimenters across multiple science domains will highlight their use of FABRIC to push forward compelling experiments. The FABRIC team will set the stage for the future of FABRIC and solicit feedback from fellow participants during talks and open mic sessions. Additionally, the team will host an information session for users interested in becoming FABRIC Ambassadors. Attendees will get the chance to explore what FABRIC has to offer, connect with the FABRIC community, and provide feedback to the FABRIC team.

During the week, FABRIC and NRP will co-host two events — a demo night and a social program — giving attendees from both workshops a chance to connect and create pathways for collaboration. Additionally, attendees will have the chance to hear keynotes and plenary discussions built around the interests of both FABRIC users and NRP members.
